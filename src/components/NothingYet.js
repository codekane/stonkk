        It's probably because you haven't clicked a button.

        Now, don't get me wrong. I agree with you. I think this would be a wonderful place to put some tasty analytics.
        You know. Really show you where the money is at. But I'm gonna be honest.
        I haven't collected that data yet. It's a poof -- a mystery. And I've got to write a bunch new back-end code to collect
        the tasty data that your troubled soul requires. In the meantime, I've collected a modicum of data on various stocks taht you can peruse,
        just by clicking those "buttons" right over to your left.
